Asteroid Rage is a classic arcade space shooter based on the origin Asteroids released by Atari in 1979. The player controls a spaceship in a field of bloodthirsty asteroids out to destroy all non-asteroidian life. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids without colliding. If a player loses all his lives, it's game over!

## How to Play

Click the start button to begin the game.  Your ship and the asteroids will be randomly spawned on your screen. Use the 'A' and 'D' keys to rotate your ship, and use the 'W' and 'S' keys to give your ship thrust in the direction it is pointing. Hit 'spacebar' to shoot those Asteroids out of spacetime and save the universe from their evil ways! See how long you can survive!
